Polymyxin B is generally indicated for susceptible Gram negative infections of the urinary tract, meninges, and blood stream<a href='reference://label-reference-DB00781'>\u00b3</a>.",
        "mechanismOfAction": "The alpha and gamma diaminobutyric acid of a positively charged polymyxin B forms an electrostatic interaction with the phosphate groups of a negatively charged lipid A on the outer membrane of a Gram negative bacterium<a href='reference://reference-A176426'>\u00b2</a>. Calcium and Magnesium ions are displaced from phosphates of the membrane lipids, destabalising the lipopolysaccharide (LPS), increasing membrane permeability, causing cytoplasmic leaking, and killing the cell<a href='reference://reference-A176426'>\u00b2</a>.\nPolymyxin B can also bind and neutralize LPS released during bacterial lysis, preventing reactions to endotoxin<a href='reference://reference-A176426'>\u00b2</a>.\nA third activity of polymyxin B is the inhibition of type II NADH-quinone oxidoreductases in the bacterial inner membrane, which are essential for respiration<a href='reference://reference-A176426'>\u00b2</a>.\nPolymyxin is active against common Gram negative bacteria but not Gram negative cocci, Gram positive bacteria, or anaerobic bacteria<a href='reference://reference-A176426'>\u00b2</a>.",
        "absorption": "Administration by the oral route does not lead to absorption<a href='reference://reference-A176426'>\u00b2</a>.",
        "proteinBinding": "Polymyxin B is 79% to 92% bound to proteins<a href='reference://reference-F4151'>\u2076</a>. Polymyxin B is likely 92 to 99% protein bound in circulation, though the exact proteins have not been identified<a href='reference://reference-A176420'>\u2077</a>.",
        "metabolism": "There is little data available for the metabolism of polymyxin B<a href='reference://reference-A176432'>\u2074</a>. In one study, &lt;1% of polymyxin B was eliminated through the kidneys and it had not been metabolised<a href='reference://reference-A176432'>\u2074</a>. Polymyxin B has also been found in bile, not having undergone metabolic processes<a href='reference://reference-A176390'>\u2075</a>.",
        "routeOfElimination": "Polymyxin B is proposed to be primarily eliminated through renal tubular reabsorption and non-renal pathways<a href='reference://reference-A176390'>\u2075</a>\u207b<a href='reference://reference-F4151'>\u2076</a>. Urine collection in humans and animals show &lt;5% of polymyxin B eliminated from the kidneys<a href='reference://reference-A176390'>\u2075</a>. However, a Canadian product monograph states the drug is primarily eliminated through the kidneys and that 60% of polymyxin B is recovered in the urine<a href='reference://reference-F4151'>\u2076</a>. This discrepancy can be explained by the 12 to 24 hour lag time between administration and significant elimination of polymyxin B<a href='reference://reference-F4151'>\u2076</a>. Non-renal elimination is not well understood but all 4 components of polymyxin B have been detected in bile<a href='reference://reference-A176390'>\u2075</a>.",
        "toxicity": "Nephrotoxicity can occur in patients as polymyxin B is thought to accumulate in renal cells after renal tubular reabsorption<a href='reference://reference-A176390'>\u2075</a>. This accumulation can lead to apoptosis of renal cells and decrease in renal function<a href='reference://reference-A176399'>\u2078</a>. In recent studies, acute kidney injury (AKI) has been seen in 31.3% to 39.4% of patients receiving polymyxin B<a href='reference://reference-A176399'>\u2078</a>.\nOverdose cases can cause neuromuscular block leading to apnea, muscular weakness, vertigo, transient facial parasthesia, slurred speed, vasomotor instability, visual disturbance, confusion, psychosis, and respiratory arrest<a href='reference://reference-F4151'>\u2076</a>. Renal failure has also been seen through decreased urine output, and increased serum concentrations of blood urea nitrogen<a href='reference://reference-F4151'>\u2076</a>.\nOverdose of polymyxin B is treated by stopping the drug and beginning symptomatic treatment<a href='reference://reference-F4151'>\u2076</a>. Intravenous administration of mannitol may enhance renal clearance, and hemodialysis may manage renal complications<a href='reference://reference-F4151'>\u2076</a>.\nSafety of polymyxin B has not been established in pregnancy, breast feeding, pediatrics, and geriatrics<a href='reference://reference-F4151'>\u2076</a>. Polymyxin B should no be used in pregnancy unless the benefit outweighs the risk<a href='reference://reference-F4151'>\u2076</a>. Nursing mothers should either stop nursing or stop polymyxin B treatment depending on the risks to both the mother and child<a href='reference://reference-F4151'>\u2076</a>. Pediatric patients should be frequently monitored for renal function and no dosing information is available in children under 2 years of age<a href='reference://reference-F4151'>\u2076</a>. Geriatric patients should have renal function assessed before and regularly during therapy<a href='reference://reference-F4151'>\u2076</a>.",
